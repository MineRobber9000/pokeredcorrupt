pokeredcorrupt v1.0
===================

'pokeredcorrupt.gbc' and 'pokeredcorrupt.sym' are based on Pokemon Red.

'pokebluecorrupt.gbc' and 'pokebluecorrupt.sym' are based on Pokemon Blue.

The only thing that changes is the base game and some content.

Description:
Pokemon Red but with a built-in memory corruptor!

Set $C000 to any non-zero value and the game will corrupt memory every frame!

Gameshark codes (for emulators that don't have easy-to-use debuggers):
'010100C0' - set $C000 to $01, turning on the corruptor  
'010000C0' - set $C000 to $00, turning off the corruptor
